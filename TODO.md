# TODO

## Thoughts

- three types(enum): event, todo, eventodo
- make interfaces for them (data structure)
- todo is simple, just a few words
- event is big, with a lot of fields
- drag and drop, how to do it `next-ver`
    - **important** feature to implement
    - a custom event card is needed

## UI

- [ ] `MVP` Basic Todo App with Redux, Storage
- [ ] reverse engineering on amie.so calendar
- [ ] self-maintained calendar component

## Data Structure

- [ ] redux store base state management
- [ ] storage management: local storage, indexedDB, etc.

## Framework

- [ ] `evaluation` `breaking-changes` migrate to Next.js Framework, could takes sometime
- [ ] `next-ver` Backend Data Sync...
